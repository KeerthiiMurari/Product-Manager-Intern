A Creative Kickstart.

Interactive Onboarding & Template Library.

Overview

To address the needs of first-time users and enhance the creative workflows within the AR
application, this proposal recommends the integration of two key features: an interactive
onboarding guide and a template library for quick content creation. First-time users of AR
applications often encounter a steep learning curve, as they must familiarize themselves with
unfamiliar navigation patterns, numerous interactive tools, and creative possibilities. This
early phase is critical, as many users decide whether to continue using an app based on their

initial experience. Confusion or frustration during onboarding can lead to high drop-off rates,
thereby impacting user engagement and long-term retention.
An interactive onboarding guide provides step-by-step visual and contextual assistance as
users navigate the core app features for the first time. By overlaying real-time tips and
demonstrations within the actual interface, this guide allows users to become comfortable at
their own pace, facilitating a smoother transition from novice to confident user. It lowers the
barrier to entry and builds user confidence by visually showcasing how to utilize creative
elements, camera controls, editing tools, and sharing options.
Complementing this, the introduction of a template library allows users to jumpstart their
creative journey without being overwhelmed by a blank canvas. The library offers a curated
selection of ready-made AR templates catering to diverse scenarios—such as selfies,
product demonstrations, or storytelling. New users can select a template that fits their
needs, then easily customize it to produce impressive AR experiences even with limited prior
knowledge. This approach not only accelerates content creation but also stimulates
creativity and exploration of the app’s features.
Together, these enhancements are designed to streamline the onboarding process, reduce
early user confusion, foster creativity from day one, and ultimately strengthen user
engagement and retention within the AR application.

What Is Mixed Reality?

Insightful perspectives Made with care
Mixed reality combines the digital
and physical worlds, enabling organic
and intuitive 3D interactions between
humans, computers, and the
environment.

Mixed reality;users interact with and
manipulate both physical and virtual
items and environments, using
next-generation sensing and imaging
technologies.

"The most powerful technology is
the kind that disappears—leaving
only the experience behind."
— John Maeda, Technologist and Designer

User Problems
1. Confusing Interface
AR apps often have complex interfaces with layered controls, multiple creative tools, and
camera features.
First-time users may struggle to understand the navigation or find core tools.
Navigating without clear guidance can quickly lead to frustration.
2. Intimidation of a Blank Canvas
New users may not know how to begin creating AR content.
The absence of starting points or creative direction can discourage those less familiar with
digital content creation.
Facing a blank canvas can make users feel pressured or uncertain, lowering their confidence.
3. Lack of Examples or Templates

Without built-in examples or templates, users may not realize what’s possible with the app.
This limits exploration and creative output, especially for beginners who benefit from visual
inspiration.
4. Static Onboarding Experience
Traditional onboarding is often limited to text or basic tutorials, which may not be absorbed
effectively.
Users may find it difficult to translate instructions into meaningful actions within the AR
environment.
This results in a slower learning curve and lower early engagement.
Proposed Solutions
1. Interactive Onboarding Guide
Introduce a step-by-step, visually-guided onboarding process.
Use contextual prompts and interactive demonstrations tailored to what the user is doing in
real-time.
Highlight key buttons, creative tools, and navigation tips as users explore.
Allow users to “test” features in a safe, guided mode without risk or confusion.
Keep explanations short, actionable, and easy to revisit later.
2. Comprehensive Template Library
Provide a diverse set of pre-made AR templates for different use cases (e.g., selfies, product
demos, storytelling).
Let users start with a template, making it less intimidating than starting from scratch.
Enable customization of templates to foster creativity and skill development.
Embed helpful tips within templates, guiding users in making edits and experimenting.
Regularly update the template library to stay fresh and inspiring for both new and
experienced users.
